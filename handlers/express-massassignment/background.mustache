## Background

Mass assignment is an important security issue in MongoDB. MongoDB allows the programmer to insert a document into a collection by inserting a single JSON object with all the model attributes using the *collection.insert()* function. If the code sends that one JSON object to the *insert()* function and that object contains untrusted data, it results in a mass assignment vulnerability. Attackers can leverage this vulnerability to insert values into attributes that they shouldnâ€™t have access to.
