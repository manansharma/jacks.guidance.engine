The attached patch modifies the way you are creating the session object by setting the httpOnly attribute to true.
```javascript
var {{session_variable}} = require("express-session");

{{app_variable}}.use({{session_variable}}({{{guidance_advice}}}));
```
**Note**: If you have any JavaScript code reading the session cookie on the client side, this code will stop working after our change. In general, it is a bad practice to manipulate the session cookie on the client side. If your code is doing so, consider modifying it.
